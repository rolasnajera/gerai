# Gerai Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gerai! In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, we must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Gerai and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
